# AMP HTML TUTORIALS ⚡

[AMP HTML](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/about-amp.html) is a way to build web pages that render with reliable and fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.  AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies; an AMP page will load (quickly) in any modern browser.
